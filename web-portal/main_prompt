Create code to have a front end website using react that has a landing page, a sign up page that collects standard user information, and a login page that are publicly visible. Then have a profile page that is behind a private route that displays the persons profile data that is collected by the sign up page and have it be editable by the user. Also create a private route for a members only landing page with a h1 tag that says " Hello " then the users first name centered. Create a back end using node.js that leverages postgres for its database that will store the data collected by the sign up form. Have full CRUD functionality for the form.
